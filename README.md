# âœ¨ 100 days of web projects âœ¨

Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's [180 websites in 180 days](http://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html), Elle Luna's [100 day project](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days) and Wes Bos' [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course, I want to learn and practice different languages, technologies and libraries for the web in 100 small projects or exercises ðŸ“š.

I am using the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) emoji guide for commit messages.

## ðŸ“œ The rules

1. I will practice everyday for 100 days - even if it's just 15 minutes
2. A project has no time limit. Every little or bigger project is different.
3. Perfect is the enemy of good. I will not be afraid of making mistakes.
4. 100 days of web projects does not necessarily mean 100 _different_  projects. I will focus on working on _some cool_  projects for 100 days.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I will focus on

- Languages I already know ant want to practice: **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**
- Languages to learn: **Elm**
- Deep dive into **React.js** (as I already know it on a more advanced level)
- Learning **Vue.js**
- Artsy Coding: **three.js**, **Canvas**, **SVG**, ...
